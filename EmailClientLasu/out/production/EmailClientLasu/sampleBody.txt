   Let’s face it, trying to please everyone is absolutely impossible and a sure way to set yourself up for unhappiness. In the poem “The Road Not Taken” By Robert Frost he is trying to explain that to his audience about his experience with that decision. From the beginning, Frost explains that people have their own paths to take. He goes on to explain that as much as he wishes he could take the same path as another, so that they wouldn’t part, that is just something that he would not be able to do. Many times in life you meet others and even become the best of friends, or maybe its family members you were once very close with, and then suddenly you grow apart, or have a falling out, but even before that happens your paths are never quite the same. Individuality is huge, it’s an important factor in how we all decide to live our lives. Even if we were raised by the same parents in the same household with the same rules, we all end up in different places whether it be physically, mentally, spiritually; which is what Frost is trying to point out in his poem.</p><br><br>
